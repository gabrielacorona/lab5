<h1>  lab5 - Shopping list </h1>
 <p>Using JavaScript add an event listener to the “Add Item” button. This event should pick up
the value that the user types in the text input and it should generate a <li> element that
you must add to the <ul> located in the index.html. The just created <li> element should
have the name of the item and two buttons.
